0.1. REN'PY  1
0.1 Ren'Py
The Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine is a free software engine
which facilitates the creation of visual novels, a form of
computer-mediated storytelling. Ren'Py is a portmanteau
of ren'ai , a type of game made using Ren'Py; and Python,
theprogramming language that Ren'Pyruns on. Ren'Pyhas
proved attractive to English-language hobbyists; over 850
games use the Ren'Py engine, nearly all in English.*
[4]*
[5]
0.1.1 Features
Ren'Py natively supports almost all typical visual novel features, including branching stories, save file systems, rollback to previous points in the story, a variety of scene transitions andso on. Ren'Pyscripts have a screenplay-likesyntax, and can also include blocks of Python code to allow
advanced users to add new features of their own. As well,
tools are included in the engine distribution to  obfuscate
scripts and archive game assets to mitigate copyright infringement.*
[6]
Ren'Py is built on pygame, which is built with Python on
SDL. Ren'Py is officially supported on Windows, recent
versions of Mac OS X, and Linux; and can be installed
via the package managers of the Arch Linux (as an AUR
package), Ubuntu, Debian, and Gentoo (in experimental
overlay*
[7]) Linux distributions. It has also been ported to
Android,
*
[6] as well as OpenBSD and as of the pre-release
of version 7, iOS.*

[5] Love expectedthegame to reach
as many people as her prior work,“a dozen or so people";
instead, the free game was noticed by video game publications andwebsitessuchas PC Gamer and Gamasutra andreceived much more attention, becoming what Love believes
was“a defining point in [her] writing career”.
*
[3]*
[7]*
[8]
Widely praised by critics, Gamasutra named Digital  as a
runner-up in their “Best Indie Games of 2010”list.*
[8]
Love felt that Digital  's success turned her from a writer
into an indie game developer.*
[3]
The“ Amie”operating system that servesas Digital 's user interface
After Digital , Love worked on her first commercial game
project, Love and Order , a dating simulation by video game
designer Riva Celso. She did writing and design work for
the game, set in the Crown attorney's office in Montreal,
which was released in February 2011.*
[9] Love describes
the gameas“notreally mybestwork”, as dating simulations
are not her strong point. Nevertheless, proceeds from the
game were enough to support her financially for a while, and
showed Love that creating games and visual novels could be
a full-time profession.*
[10] In 2011, she spent the month
of March working on another visual novel: don't take it personally, babe, it just ain't your story, which was released as
a free download on 4 April 2011.*
[11] A spiritual sequel to
Digital , the game follows John Rook, a private school literary teacher in 2027, over the course of a semester. He can
see students' private messages at any time via the school's
3
4 CHAPTER 1. VISUAL NOVEL DEVELOPERS 
social network.  Don't take it personally deals with themes
of internet privacy and relationships in the future.*
[12] The
game was again widely praised by critics, with The Daily
Telegraph awarding the game for“Best Script”in its video
game awards of 2011.*
[13]
Analogue 's primary interface, featuring AI character *Hyun-ae
That summer, Love began working on a larger, commercial
game.*
[10] She was beginning to believe that her games
could be successful commercially, a belief supported by
messages to that effect by fans of her previous works.*
[14]
The game, Analogue: A Hate Story, was released in February 2012.*
[15] Love dropped out of university during the
game's development in her fourth year of an English undergraduate degree. She felt that she was “not really
learning a whole lot”and was unable to balance school
and work on the game.*
[16] Set centuries after Digital: A
Love Story, the plot of Analogue revolves around an unnamed investigator, who is tasked with discovering the reasonfor an interstellar ship's disappearance once itreappears
600 years after “going dark”. The game's themes focus similarly around human/computer interaction, interpersonal relationships, and LGBT issues;*
[17] but focus primarily on "transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness
and cosplay.”*
[18] The release of Analogue, Love's first
commercial game as main developer, currently fully supports her financially.*
[16] Although Analogue is a sequel
“of sorts”to Digital , the time difference between the two
games means that they are connected more in spirit than directly, similar to the connections between Digital  and Don't 
take it personally.
*
[14] Analogue sold over 30,000copies by
August 2012, and has inspired the release of a soundtrack
album bythegame's composer, Isaac Schankler, as well as a
commercial expansion to the game, titled Hate Plus , which
is intended to further develop the backstory of *Mute and
the ship.*
[19]*
[20]*
[21]*
[22]*
[23]
Since the release of Hate Plus , Love has begun work on a
new game, titled Ladykiller in a Bind . The full name of the
game is My Twin Brother Made Me Crossdress As Him And 
Now I Have To Deal With A Geeky Stalker And A Domme
BeautyWho Want Me InA Bind!!, andthe game isdescribed
byLove as“an erotic visual novel aboutsocial manipulation
and girls tying up other girls”.
*
[24]
1.1.2 Influences and philosophy
Christine Love describes herself as “a writer first, and a
game designersecond”, as writing was her initial goal.*
[16]
She originally pictured her future as that of a novelist,
with a day job as a programmer to support herself.*
[25]
Love describes her games as being about“our relationship
with technology, about human relationships in general, and
about seeing things from different perspectives,”as well as
having “a ton of words”. She strives for her stories to be
true and sincere, but not necessarily realistic.*
[14] Love is
also interested in the portrayal of gender and sexuality in
video games; in Digital  and Analogue, she was careful to
avoid mentioning or assuming the gender of the player or
the character they control, though the love interests in the
games are female. Privately, however, she thinks of them
as female, as her intention was to create games that could
be easily appreciated by queer people such as herself, without having to project themselves onto a relationship that did
not match up to their perceptions. Love believes that indie
games have“more meaningful depictions of queer experiences”than those from larger studios.*
[25]*
[26]
Love's design process hasbecome more refined astime goes
on. For Digital , she did not plan anything in advance; while
for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing
game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games,
however,she does a lotofresearchinto thetime periods and
issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily
the best way to tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to
communicate with it as a writer.*

Visual novels by Christine Love
2.1 ''Digital: A Love Story'' (2010)
Digital: A Love Story is a 2010 indie visual novel by video
game developer Christine Love and released for free in
February 2010. The game's story is linear, with the player's
actions unable to significantly change the course of the plot.
Set “five minutes into the future of 1988”, Digital  tells
the story of the protagonist's online relationship with a girl
andtheir attemptsto solve a mystery surrounding thedeaths
of several artificial intelligences.
*
[1] The game is presented
entirely through the interface of a 1980s computer with online Bulletin Board System posts and messages from other
characters;*
[1] the protagonist's own messages are implied
but never shown. The game was received positively, with
critics especially praising the game's writing and plot, and
it was noted in lists of the best indie games of 2010.
2.1.1 Gameplay
A screenshot of the game, showing the Amie interface. A message is 
open on the screen; behind it can be seen a music player application
window and a message storage application window.
Digital: A Love Story is a visual novel, or interactive fiction
game, where the game's story is told primarily through text.
The game is presented as if on a computer from the late
1980srunning an“Amie”(a reference to Amiga) operating
system.
*
[2] The player logs into Bulletin Board Systems, or
BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other
people. Messages received from other characters in the
game aredisplayed through a different program on thecomputer screen. Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of
the telephone number for that board, which the player must
type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephonenumber to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbersfound online.*
[3]
Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a
user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.*
[2]
Many of the messages sent by the player and the replies
back to those messages have no effect on the game. The
messages that the player sends are never explicitly revealed,
though their contents can be inferred from replies received
from other characters in the game.*
[2] The player, therefore, is unable to send a “wrong”reply or message, and
the game cannot be lost. The player does not have a choice
in the direction that the story takes, though the game requires the player to correctly decipher what actions to take
before the plot can advance.*
[3] A single playthrough ofthe
game takes around one hour.*
[2]
2.1.2 Plot
The game, set“five minutes into the future of 1988”,
*
[1]
opens with the silent protagonist, whose name is given by
the player, having just obtained a computer. When the
player checkstheir messages, they learn the telephone number to the Lake City Local  BBS, a local board, and can then
log on to there.*
[4] One of the topics posted to that board
is some poetry by a girl named "*Emilia"; when the player
responds to her message, the two start up a conversation.
While this conversation is ongoing, the player learns of another BBS and of a board whose telephone number is in
another area code. They also learn of an illegal method to
get access to boards like that, which would otherwise require the purchase of long distance calling cards. The con11
12 CHAPTER 2. VISUAL NOVELS BY CHRISTINE LOVE 
versation between the player and *Emilia, which is inferred
to have taken place over a much longer duration of time
than has transpired in reality, begins at this point to show
*Emilia forming an attachment to the player.*
[5] Soon after, *Emilia confesses to the player that she loves them;
however, the host computer for Lake City Local breaks
down, leaving the player unable to contact her.*
[6]
Soon afterwards the owner of Lake City Local contacts the
player with a garbled message that *Emilia hadtried to send
to them. This message implies that *Emilia is in danger,
asking the player to contact someone named *Paris, and
provides a mass of binary code.
*
[7] The player has no context for this message; but after hacking into another BBS,
The Gibson, the player finds a cryptic message reposted
from another board saying that there are several artificial
intelligences (AIs) around the world that have been recently
“killed”, naming *Emilia as one of them.*
[8] The player
hacks into the source board for this message, and finds a
history of artificial intelligence posted there by *Blue Sky,
a “historian”AI.
According to *Blue Sky'srecords, duringARPANET's creation in the 1970s, the American government had also created an AI. This AI, *Mother, in turn created child AIs,
but its first attempt spread out of control and had to be
destroyed by a virus that spread after it later officially explained by the government as the real-life  Creeper and
*Reaper viruses.*
[9] Mother's later attempts, which could
only exist on one system at a time, were more successful,
and these AIs left the ARPANET in favor of the Internet
when it was developed.*
[10] *Reaper, however, continued
to spread and destroyed any AI it found, such as *Emilia.
The player finds *Paris, another AI and *Emilia's brother,
on an ARPANET node, who explains that compiling the
binary code in *Emilia's message can recreate her.*
[11]
The player compiles *Emilia onto their system, and the two
learn of a “payload”that the other AIs have developed,
which can cause *Reaper to self-terminate; however, infecting *Reaper with it requires that an AI be recompiled
with it as living bait, meaning permanent deletion. Realizing that they have no other choice, *Emilia becomes the
payload carrier. After a final conversation, the player allows *Emilia to sacrifice herself, saving the AIs and ending
the game.*
[12]
2.1.3 Development
Digital   was created and released by  Christine Love in
February 2010. Although it was not her first game, it was
her first successful one; Love noted in January 2011 that her
previous titles were played by “less than a dozen”people,
while Digital  had been played by “countless thousands”,
gotten onto the reading lists of university classes, and became “a defining point in [her] writing career”.
*
[13] It
was also her largest game to date; prior to its release she
thought of herself only as a writer, not as a game developer.
She made Digital  as a visual novel rather than just prose
because she felt that immersing the player into the game
would allow the story to resonate with them more than just
reading the text.*
[14] Love chose to set the game in the
1980s rather than more recently because she felt that the
computing systems and number of people online then created a sense of isolation, which she felt was more conducive
to both the romance and mystery aspects of the story.*
[15]
One of Love's influences on the gameplay was Uplink ; she
initially intended to reference more of its gameplay mechanics but eventually“streamlined”much of the hacking
elements of Digital  away.*
[14]
Although *Emilia is explicitly female, Love purposely ensured that the protagonist's gender is never stated, as she
wanted them to be a blank slatethat theplayerwould project
themselves into, rather than a character that the player
would control.*
[16] She intended this, combined with never
showing what the protagonist actually says, to create more
immersion in the story.*
[14] Unofficially, however, Love
thought of the relationship as “queer”, both in respect to
theplayer's gender andin respect to *Emilia as“a confused
adolescent falling in love with someone she's not supposed
to"; Love hasstatedthat this did not come across asstrongly
as she intended.*
[14] Love has said that one of the intended
messages of the game was the importance of love and relationships, though not necessarily romantic love; as an example she specifically referenced *Emilia valuing saving her
“family”due to her love for them over her adolescent love
for the player.*
[14]
2.1.4 Reception
The writing and story of the game were especially praised
by reviewers. Kieron Gillen of Rock, Paper, Shotgun said
that after playing it, he“can't think of a better love story in
the [W]estern medium”, and that the terse and minimalist
prose worked well to create clearly defined characters.*
[2]
A reviewer from The Economist  called the story “engaging”, saying that it provided a “memorable and thoughtprovoking experience”.
*
[3] In an analysis of the game's
story,EmilyShort ofGamasutra called thedecision to leave
the protagonist blank rather than making a viewpoint character“brilliant”, saying that it made the entire game work
much better than it otherwise would.*
[17] A reviewer from
The A.V. Club, grading the game as an “A”, called the
story “moving”.
*
[18] The majority of the criticism for
the game was in regards to the interface used to navigate
the online world; while The Economist  found it quirky and
realistic, Gillen felt that it made it easy fortheplayer to miss
a key message, leaving the player stuck with no direction as
2.1. ''DIGITAL: A LOVE STORY'' (2010) 13
to where to turn.*
[2]*
[3]
Gamasutra named Digital  as one of the runners-up in their
“Best Indie Games of 2010”list.*
[19] It was chosen as a
“freeware game pick”by Tim W. of IndieGames, Gamasutra's independent games site, who said that it was “an
absorbing experience that no other game from this day and
age canoffer.”*
[20] IndieGames also named it numbertwo
in their“Top Freeware Adventure Games of 2010”.
*
[21]
PC Gamer  listed it as number seven in their “20 Free PC
Games”feature in May 2011, saying that it was “an hour
of gorgeously crafted, personality-imbued indie gaming.”
*
[22]
Love later made a "spiritual sequel", Don't take it personally, babe, it just ain't your story,
*
[23] and then another
game“that further extends the non-linear style of Digital”
, Analogue: A Hate Story.

2.2 ''don't take it personally, babe, it
just ain't your story'' (2011)
don't take it personally, babe, it just ain't your story  is a
2011 indie video game by Christine Love. Intended as a
spiritual sequel to Love's Digital: A Love Story, the game
was developed over the course of a month and was released
as a freedownloadon April 4, 2011. Don't take it personally
is a visual novel, with the majority of the plot taking place
outside of the player's control except for key decisions. It
follows a new high school literature teacher in 2027 overthe
courseof a semester, with the ability to seeprivate messages
between students at any time without their knowledge. It
deals with themes of privacy and relationships in the future.
The game was received positively, with critics praising the
interplay between the metafictional elements of the story
and those of the game itself, with special acknowledgment
reserved for the writing.
2.2.1 Gameplay
Don't take it personally is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game where the majority of the story is told through
still images of the speaking characters in front of animestyle backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, the teacher in a school, with
the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other
characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go
backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key
moments. At these points, the player is presented with two
or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is
chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.*

A screenshot of the game, showing an Amie conversationthread between several of the students during a conversation in the classroom
with Charlotte.
In a departure from most visual novels the player can also
see, at any time, the equivalent of texts and Facebook postings between the students on a system called AmieConnect (often shortened to “Amie”), as well as conversation threads on a 4chan-like imageboard that serve as foreshadowing for future plot points. These extra conversations
take place in parallel to in-person conversations between
characters, occasionally at the same time; the player is notified anytime a new text message or post is made. A single
playthrough of the game takes “over an hour”.
*
[2]
2.2.2 Scenario
Setting
The game is set in a private high school in Ontario, in 2027.
Theplayerfollows a new 11th-grade literature teacher at the
school, JohnRook, who hasrecentlyhad hissecond divorce
and is undergoing, in his words, a “bizarre midlife crisis”
that has led him to quit his career in computers and become
a teacher.*
[3] The students in his class are Arianna BelleEssai, Kendall Flowers, Taylor Gibson, Charlotte Grewal,
Isabella Hart, Nolan Striukas, and Akira Yamazaki. Rook
and all ofthe students have school-issued computers, which
the students use to communicate between each other in private and public messages. Rook, and therefore the player,
can see all of the messages that the students send, even the
private ones; the school administration has told Rook that
it is for monitoring online bullying, and that he is not to let
anyone know that he can see students' private messages.*
[4]
Plot
Soon after the game opens, the player learns that Kendall
and Charlotte have just broken up out of a lesbian relationship,*
[5] while a few weeks prior Taylor and Nolan had
2.2. ''DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY, BABE, IT JUST AIN'T YOUR STORY'' (2011) 15
broken up out of a heterosexual relationship.*
[6] Arianna
develops a crush on the teacher, which in the player's first
decision point Rook can reciprocate or not.*
[7] Akira soon
comes out as gay, finding to his dismay that everyone else
already knew.*
[8] He then attempts to enter into a relationship with Nolan, who is unsure how to respond;*
[9] Rook
can encouragehim to tryit out orlet him decide on his own,
but he enters a relationship with Akira regardless.*
[10]
The next day, Isabella misses a meeting she set up with
Rook, and does not return to the class. Through Amie texts
andwall posts, the otherstudentsinsinuate that she committed suicide,*
[11] while the school is unable to provide Rook
with any contact information for her.*
[12] Class continues
without her, and a little while later Arianna, if the player
rejected her earlier in the game, makes another attempt to
have a relationship with Rook. The player may choose to
acceptorreject her again.*
[13] ThroughAmie, Rook learns
that both Charlotte and Kendall wish to resume their relationship, and can influence Charlotte to try again or not,
which changes whether or not they get back together.
*
[14]
Taylor jealously and unsuccessfully tries to drive a wedge
between Nolan and Akira.*
[15]
Asthe end ofterm approaches, Rook begins getting strange
emails about Isabella's death, and begins seeing shinigami
figures. Upset by these occurrences, when Akira's mother
asks to speak to him concerning misuses of Amie, he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students' conversations.*
[16] When he meets her, he finds that
Isabella is alive and had simply moved away; the students
made it look like she was dead via Amie as a prank that
got out of control. Furthermore they already knew that he
could see their messages; Akira's mother explains that the
students have no idea of online privacy, having always had
technology like Amie, and assumed that anything they put
online might be read by anyone.*
[17] The game ends with
Rook having a casual lunch with the students, a date with
Arianna, or neither, depending on the choices made during
the game by the player.
2.2.3 Development
Don't take it personally was developed over the course of
a month, and was released as a free download on April 4,
2011.*
[18] It was written and developed by Christine Love,
with artwork made for the game by Auro-Cyanide, artwork
licensed from Tokudaya and Kimagure After, and with music licensed from Rengoku Teien and propanmode.*
[19]
It was created using the Ren'Py  engine. It was Love's
longest game to date, and her first attempt at a game with a
branching storyline.*
[18] It was intended as “a spiritual
sequel of sorts”to Digital: A Love Story, a 2010 game
by Love.*
[20] The game was made for NaNoRenO (National Ren'ai Game Writing Month), a month-long contest
in the vein of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) where developers attempt to create a visual novel
in one month.*
[20] Love's favorite character to write was
Kendall.*
[21]
2.2.4 Reception
Don't take it personally was chosen as a “freeware game
pick”by IndieGames's Michael Rose, who said that it was
worth playing through multiple times in order to see the
different paths the story takes depending on the player's
choices.*
[22] Pete Davidson of GamePro noted the game as
an exampleofthe“creativity”missingin many large-budget
titles, and praised the story, calling Love“a writer first and
a game developer second.”*
[23] Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as “a game about love,
sex andthe internet”that was“capable of being profoundly
moving”and was about“what it is to feel like someone’s
kicked me straight in the heart.”*
[1] He praisedLove's ability to use dialogue to effect an emotional response, though
he noted that the game seemed to lose some of its impact
in the final chapters and felt that the use of the “12chan”
threads as a Greek chorus was “perhaps a meta-layer too
far”.
*
[1]
Aaron Poppleton of PopMatters called the game “a meditation on privacy in the modern age”and“one of the more
thoughtful games to come out in a long time.”He criticized
the art direction of the game, saying that the limitation of
creating the game in a month led to poor artwork and an unpolished presentation that lets down the possibilities of the
story. He did note that the story and writing of the game
made the downsides of the game “almost entirely a moot
point”, and that it is a very strong game.*
[2] Pete Davidson
of PC World , in an article about the treatment ofsexuality in
video games, called out the game as an example of a game
that used sexual themes maturely to explore love and relationships.*
[24] Emily Short of Gamasutra, in a discussion
about the game, said that it was definitely worth playing and
full of“charming characters, colorful dialogue, and important questions”, but criticized the uneven exploration of issuesregarding privacy versus personal boundaries. She said
that the game's lack of focus on Rook's issues with personal
and professional boundaries was a weakness in the story,
given that the distinction between boundaries and privacy
was crucial to the plot.*
[25] Love collated common criticisms and reviews of the game on her blog, summarizing
that while it was less praised than Digital: A Love Story,
most players seemed to like the way she wrote the relationships and overall story, though her portrayal of Rook was
weak and that many players seemed to miss that he was intended to be“an absolutely awful teacher”and that the potential relationship with Arianna was intended to be creepy

and make the player feel bad. She also noted that her use of
licensed artwork was detracting from the game's potential
in comparison to the reaction to the custom works.*

The Daily Telegraph gave the visual novel the award for
“Best Script”in its video game awards of 2011, stating that
“Love'slayerednarrative of a high school teacher embroiled
in his student’s worries goes places most mainstreamvideo

2.3 ''Analogue: A Hate Story''
(2012-2013)
Analogue: A Hate Story (Korean: 아날로그) is a visual
novel created by independent designer and visual novelist
Christine Love. It was created with the Ren'Py engine, and
was first released for download on the author's website in
February 2012.*
[2] A sequel set centuries after Love's earlier work, Digital: A Love Story (2010), Analogue revolves
around an unnamed investigator, who is tasked with discovering the reason for an interstellar ship's disappearance
once it reappears after 600 years.*
[3] The game's themes
focus similarly around human/computer interaction, interpersonal relationships, and LGBT issues;*
[4] but focus primarily on "transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness
and cosplay.”*
[5]
Analogue has a word count of about 59,000 words.*
[6]
As of December 2012, Analogue has sold at least 40,000
copies.*
[7]
2.3.1 Gameplay
Analogue: A Hate Story is a visual novel featuring semistatic manhwa-style character images, and focused on reading text logs. Using the mouse and keyboard, the player
interacts with the Mugunghwa 's main computer to read log
entries, communicate with the AIs, and occasionally enter
commands directly into the vessel's computer system. At
any time in the game, the player can save their game, adjust
options, etc.
The game's primary interface, featuring one of the two primary
characters, the AI *Hyun-ae
The main user interface allows the player to read through
various diaries and letters that reveal the game's backstory
and insight into its many (deceased) characters. For the
most part, navigating this interface is similar to navigating
a basic e-mail system, in that messages are chronologically
arranged and searchable. They are grouped in usually numbered “blocks”, released to the player by *Hyun-ae or
*Mute throughout the game. For the most part, the AIs release blocks“outof order”, or do not release all entriesin a
block, forcing the player to assemble the timeline of events
out of what clues they have, and draw certain conclusions
independently until (or if) the AIs can be convinced to be
more forthcoming. In most cases, theplayer can, afterreading a log entry, show its content to the currently active AI.
This istheprimary process bywhich additionalinformation
and message blocks are revealed. Players can also type in
an entry's alphanumeric ID in the main log menu to obtain
it directly, as long as its corresponding block is decrypted.
Communication with *Hyun-ae and *Mute is limited to
choosing responses to yes-no questions.
*
[8] In the game,
*Hyun-ae explains that the ship's disrepair may have led
to the language parsing systems to malfunction, forcing
her to put the interface together from scratch.*
[9] Though
*Hyun-ae and *Mute almost never communicate directly,
the player can act as a go-between, taking a list of direct
questions from *Mute to *Hyun-ae. This is a major turning
point in the game, as the player not only receives answers
to the questions, but has occasional opportunities to voice
a third opinion on the events that led to the Mugunghwa's 
current state. The player can also access the Mugunghwa's 
override terminal, which can be used to decrypt data log
blocks, switch between AI, change costumes for *Hyun-ae,
adjust the behavior of some ship systems (a key aspect for
the meltdown sequence), and more. The override terminal
works like a basic text parser system similar to Unix shell
commands, accepting only a very limited vocabulary of instructions that must be typed directly and correctly.
18 CHAPTER 2. VISUAL NOVELS BY CHRISTINE LOVE 
Due to the branching nature of the story, the game must
be played more than once to unlock all logs to complete
the game, as it is impossible to reveal all log entries and
information from the AIs in one playthrough. A log system
separate from the game's save files displays all discovered
logs from all playthroughs, effectively tracking the player's
overall completion rate.
2.3.2 Story
Setting and characters
Set several thousand years in the future,  Analogue revolves around theMugunghwa (Hangul: 무궁화; RR: Moo-
 goonghwa), a generation ship that lost contact with Earth
some 600 years prior to the events of the game. For reasons initially unclear, society aboard the ship had degraded
from that of modern, 21st Century South Korea, to the
intensely patriarchal culture of the medieval Joseon Dynasty.
*
[10]*
[11] In the process, the ship's clocks were reset
to year 1, and the colonists began using Hanja characters to
read and write. Like many plot points throughout the game,
the reasons why such a cultural shift has occurred are lost to
time, leaving theplayer to formulate the cause on their own.
Over the three centuries after the shift, the ship's birth rates
began to gradually decline, to below even the“replacement
rate”of noble families.
*
[12] At the end ofthe third century,
the ship inexplicably went dark, falling into a state of severe
disrepair.
In Analogue 's present, 622 years later, the Mugunghwa is
discovered in orbit above “Antares B”, a star system located far out in space en route to its destination. A friend
of the protagonist's, a dispatch officer, is the one who discovers the ship on their radar; this catches the attention of
the Saeju Colony Historical Society (which suggests that
humans have established planetary colonies beyond Earth),
who sponsors the recovery of any remaining text logs that
can explain the ship's disappearance.
*
[3] The dispatch officer gives the unnamed silent protagonist, an independent
investigator, this“job”in the introduction message for its
isolation from social situations; this implies that the protagonist is somewhat asocial,
*
[3] but beyond this their personality and background is based almost entirely upon the
player's decisions. The protagonist encounters two AI cores
within the ship's computer. The first,  *Hyun-ae (Hangul:
현애; RR: Hyeon-ae), is a bright, cheerful girl who loves
cosplay, and is highly curious about the player and the future they come from. The other, *Mute,
*
[3] is the ship's
security AI and self-proclaimed “social creature”, who
outranked all but Emperor Ryu, her master and Captain of
the ship. The AIs dislike one another intensely, apparently
due to the event that led to the ship's demise. The logs the
player must recover are written by members of the Imperial
Ryu family, the noble Kim and Smith families, and those
linked to them. The game relies heavily on this unreliable
narrator mechanic, where the AI characters and log entries
thematically withhold key information fromtheplayerin order to add to the importance of certain elements of the plot
(e.g. the administrator password to the ship's computer).
Plot
In Analogue 's introductory cutscene, the protagonist receives a message from a colleague, who tasks them with
accessing the text logs aboard the Mugunghwa, and download as many as possible, as sponsored by the Saeju Colony
Historical Society.*
[3] After enabling the system AI using
a Linux-style terminal, *Hyun-ae greets the player, pleasantly shocked to find an external connection. She expresses
her gratitude to the player for contacting the ship“after so
many years”, and promises that she will do her utmost to
help access the logs.*
[9]
As the player reads the logs, *Hyun-ae provides commentary on the letters and diaries of the late inhabitants of the
Mugunghwa. A key series of logs discovered with *Hyunae is the diary of the Pale Bride, a sick girl on the ship
who was placed in stasis so her compromised immune system could be cured by future medical technology not available during her lifetime. The Pale Bride was brought out
of stasis many years later by the descendants of her immediate family, the Kim family, in order to serve as a fertile young bride to Emperor Ryu In-ho, captain of the Mu-
 gunghwa. She found herself in a culturally reverted, deeply
misogynistic society, writing that "[e]veryone's so uneducated and stupid”.
*
[13] The Pale Bride, accustomed to the
more liberal society of her own time, has difficulty assimilating with this reverted culture, and often describes youthful rebellions in her diary entries.
After giving the player a key entry from the Pale Bride's diary, *Hyun-ae reveals that she is the AI form of the Pale
Bride, and asks the player to decrypt a block of restricted
data by entering the override terminal in super-user mode
(accessible only by entering a certain password). While attempting to do so, the player encounters a corrupted AI
core and is forced to restore it to proceed. This activates
*Mute, who reveals that *Hyun-ae may be linked to the
ship's demise by referring to her as“that murderous bitch”
.
*
[14] As only one of the AIs can be active at a time (determined by keying in Linux-like terminal commands), the
path through the story and the revelations contained within
the many logs and messages branch based on decisions
made by the player - most relevantly, which AI receives the
most attention.
Upon reaching one of two criteria (obtaining a certain
percentage of the games logs, or showing *Hyun-ae
2.3. ''ANALOGUE: A HATE STORY'' (2012-2013) 19
any one of *Mute's questions), the game's main climax
occurs the  Mugunghwa 's nuclear fission  reactor enters
meltdown, endangering the AI cores, valuable data, and the
protagonist. The player must execute a series of commands
to safely shutdown the reactor and vent out residual heat,
all within 20 minutes. The player must choose which
AIs they will continue the story with prior to meltdown;
leaving their separate cores on consumes too much power
for the backup power system, and it is not possible to
activate the dormant AI from this point onwards. Once the
player has safely disabled the reactor, saving the life of the
active AI, the game will continue similarly to before, with
the player accessing logs and the surviving AI providing
commentary. Each AI reveals a different side of the
Mugunghwa's story: *Hyun-ae will assist in uncovering the
Pale Bride's perspective, while *Mute yields logs from the
noble families of the ship. More interaction will take place
between the player and the AI, until a pivot is reached
with the relationship and one of the five endings will occur.*

[26]*
[27]
Eventually, it is revealed that the Pale Bride (now *Hyunae) was brutally treated by the Kim family after they awoke
her from stasis.*
[13] After many small rebellions and increasingly serious punishments, going so far as to refusing
to bewed toEmperor Ryu, to whom she had been promised
as a bride and concubine, her adoptive parents*
[26] cut
out her tongue to prevent the young girl from speaking
out against men (a trauma *Mute was unaware of to the
game's present).*
[21] After her marriage, Hyun-ae became
close friends with the Emperor's first wife, Empress Ryu
Jae-hwa.*
[28] She calls her “stronger than I ever was”,
not letting men order her around “while still knowing her
place"; as well as the only person to notice Hyun-ae's muteness and failing health. Upon the Empress's sudden death,
Hyun-ae's sorrow and rage ultimately drove her to kill everyone she hated aboard the Mugunghwa by deactivating its
life support systems.*
[24] As the crew suffocated to death,
she retreated into the computer system as an AI by using a
“neurosynaptic”scan of her brain and a copy of *Mute's
AI coding, which she used to deactivate the security AI up
until Analogue 's present. This explains the *Hyun-ae's hatred of the Kims, *Mute's hatred of *Hyun-ae, and acts as
a key factor for the player's decisions.
The first two endings involve *Hyun-ae leaving the Mugunghwa with the protagonist, either as a companion or
lover.*
[29]*
[30] In the third ending, the protagonist leaves
without taking either AI with them (either by not saving the
ship from meltdown in time, or by prematurely downloading the logs before the end of the AI commentary has been
reached). This conclusion can also be reached if the player
opts not to download the AI data during the final conclusion.*
[31] The fourthending involves“kidnapping”*Mute,
effectively relieving her of her duties on the ship.*
[32] The
fifth ending, which can only be accessed by “cheating”
(searching manually for a log which would not normally appear on the story branch in question), involves taking both
AIs as a harem.*
[33] The game can also end by penalty for
disagreeing too much with an AI, causing the angered AI
to permanently disconnect the protagonist from the ship's
computer,*
[34] or by the “bad priorities”ending, which
occurs when the player downloads the logs during the meltdown sequence, which takes too much time, killing them in
the explosion.
Hate Plus Following Endings 1, 2, 4, and/or 5, Hate Plus 
reveals the events that took place aboard the Mugunghwa,
prior to the shift into the Joseon-like society depicted in the
original Analogue.
2.3.3 Development
When looking for a setting to place Analogue, Christine
Love settled on Korea's Joseon Dynasty, saying that it had
“always fascinated me the most for a number of reasons,
not all of them negative.”Among those reasons was how
women were dehumanizingly treated then compared to the
Goryeo Dynasty. “The plot is moved mostly by the Pale
Bride, the modern girl who can't understand what's going
on…but the crux of it, really, was trying to get into the
heads of everyone else[:] the men and women who have internalized all these awful misogynist ideals and take them
completely for granted as the way things are. So the story
really just formed itself around that question: what would
it be like to be a woman in that society? History didn't care
about the answer, but I do. The rest the modern-thinking
woman who can't possibly survive [*Hyun-ae], the women
who are forced to navigate family politics, the men who are
complicit in this whole system but can't just be dismissed
as bad people [Smith] all came naturally in that attempt to
answer it.”*
[35]*
[36]*
[37]
Love had mixed feelings about the AI characters during
development. For instance, *Hyun-ae, as the Pale Bride,
underwent almost no change from being a girl of modern
times who couldn't understand the society she was thrust
into. *Mute, apart from her position as the ship's security
AI,was an unknownwith, asLovestated“, how she'dend up
turning out.”*
[35] As *Mute's“cheerful misogyny”began
to define itself through her dialog, however, Love “started
to hate her, especially with every line I wrote…Then she
started to grow on me[. I]t was never really her fault she
was like that[;] it was just her way of surviving, I realized.”
*
[35] Neither character gave her much surprise, but Love
“definitely never anticipated feeling so much sympathy for
*Mute.”*
[35]
In an informal Kotaku interview, Love revealed that she
20 CHAPTER 2. VISUAL NOVELS BY CHRISTINE LOVE 
considered being drunk while writing a “necessity”, due
to the Joseon dynasty's reprehensible history and the nature of the research of social agendas against women. Despite her disgust at the philosophies behind  Analogue's 
misogyny, Love expressed her interest in how “ideas take
root...Nobody ever just wakes up one day and says[,] 'yeah,
I hate women, I wish we'd stop letting them read.'" *
[38]
2.3.4 Marketing and release
On April 13, 2012, Dischan Media announced that it would
distribute   Analogue: A Hate Story, along with Juniper's
Knot, through its online store.*
[39]
2.3.5 Soundtrack
Analogue' s soundtrack was composed by Isaac Schankler.
It contains eighteen tracks, with three of them included as
bonus tracks.*
[40]
2.3.6 Reception
Analogue was highly praised on both plot and interface,
with the former being more noted than the latter. Eurogamer*
[43] and JayIsGames*
[44] praised the dark and
emotional themes, pointing to how the mechanics interact
with the thematic plot.
Many bloggers and gaming media sites noted the mechanics and interface of the game as well as the plot, such
as 2chan.us*
[45] and Killscreen,*
[46]*
[47] with 2chan labelling it as a “literary and intellectual delight.”
MatthewSakeyofTap-Repeatedlyremarked that“the thing
about Christine Love is that she is a really, really good
writer, one capable of astonishing deftness in her work.”
*
[48]
PC Gamer UK gave Analogue 76 out of a 100, noting in
particular to the skilfulness of the author's structural talent.*
[49]
Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun said the brightness of
the art was contradictory to the gloomy themes.*
[50]
As of August 26, 2013, Analogue holds a Metascore of 62
on Metacritic.com.*
[41]
2.3.7 Further development
Localizations
An update for the game containing a Japanese localization was released on December 4, 2014.*
[51] The game is
also being localized by volunteers into Spanish and German.*
[52]
Sequel
Christine Love announced through Twitter that a sequel to
Analogue called Hate Plus .
*
[38] Originally planned to be
DLC before becoming full sequel release on 19 August
2013. According to an article*
[38] by Kotaku's Patricia
Hernandez, a personal friend of Love's, the sequel takes
place after the events aboard the Mugunghwa and will feature the player returning to Earth and discovering how society on board the ship broke down.
Those that finishedtheoriginal game areable to import their
save games into the sequel so that any decisions made will
be part of the new story.*

for generations, but they were just getting worse and worse.
Among noble families, they weren't even at replacement rate
anymore. I have no idea why. Nobody really ever wanted to
acknowledge it. So what I'm saying it... even ignoring the
fact that he wanted, and her suggestion was wrong, I don't
think the Emperor would have to contrive it so that there
weren't any noble daughters of proper age. The simple fact
of the matter is, eugh, that sort of incest ended up being necessary. And apparently didn't help, since even she couldn't
deliver a son anyway! No awful and inappropriate theories

Visual novels by Dischan Media
3.1 ''Juniper's Knot'' (2012)
Juniper's Knot  is a short kinetic visual novel developed by
Dischan Media.
*
[1] Created in under a month, Juniper's 
Knot  revolves around a lost boy and an imprisoned demon,
as they help overcome each other's obstacles through wit
and memory, respectively.*
[3]
3.1.1 Story
Setting and characters
The main characters of  Juniper's Knot
In the world of  Juniper's Knot , fiends (demons) unconsciously drain the life of those around them to keep themselves alive; this results in a barren, run-down town that
surrounds the manor in which the fiend is trapped. The
manner of dress, and details about the daily life of the boy
would hint that the story is set around the Industrial Revolution.
*
[4]*
[5]*
[6]
The boy was born and raised in the area of Moor, a fictional
industrial town. The fiend finds that he smells of black oil,
horses, andherbs; he explains that this is because heworked
with his parents as a farmer, andas an oil delivery boy inside
the city.*
[7]
The fiend was born many centuries ago in a moor. She has
committed many different deeds andatrocitiesfor mankind,
including: destroying a whole village,savinga baby, causing
a divorce, etc.; however, she states that none of these are
the reasons as to why she has been trapped in the magic
circle, as it no longer matters. Despite her considerable age,
the fiend appears as a young adult. She harbors feelings of
resentment towards humanity at whole, as her best friend,
“a 'miss'", was beaten and raped by men; the fiend buried
her friend before massacring the entire town.*
[4]
Plot
The novel begins with a centuries-old fiend as she thinks
about her current situation, stuck in a weathered, run-down
ballroom with nothing but fire and rubble at her side. Soon
after, a lost boy enters the room, and sees the fiend. The
fiend starts talking to the boy as well as teasing him for her
amusement, much to the wary boy's chagrin. Insisting on
making him tell her a story, the fiend gets the boy to tell her
a story about the trickery of demons;*
[7] after which the
boy decides to leave, but before the boy leaves, the fiend
sticks out her hand, begging him not to. As she does, her
hand passes the magical boundary, causing it to burst into
flame. Healing from the injury, the fiend's actions make the
boy curious enough to stay and listen to the fiend.*
[8]
When the fiend offers to cook some nuts for the boy, he
accepts, accidentally making a pact with her. As the nuts
cook overthe fire, the boy andfiend share stories about their
past. Afterwards, the boy eats the cooked nuts; is offered to
be cooked the rest of the nuts, and makes another pact with
the fiend, this time to stay until sunset; as Boy and Fiend
continue talking, the boy falls asleep while hearing part of
the fiend's story due to his tiredness, causing the fiend to
go into a fit of rage. Furious that she has not been able to
sleep, nor restforthecenturiesthatshe hasbeen stuckin the
manor, the fiend starts to cry, curse, and throw the recently
cooked nuts at the boy, hitting him a few times as he sleeps.
Some time after the boy fell asleep, he wakes up to find a
few of his nuts tangled in his hair. The fiend tries to make
him leave, but the boy decides to free the fiend from her
24
3.1. ''JUNIPER'S KNOT'' (2012) 25
constrains by planting an olive tree in her place, as the rule
of the magical circle is that one life-form enters the circle
and another one leaves.*
[8]
In the epilogue, both Fiend and Boy walk away from the
ruins to find a way to Moor. The fiend comments on how
she feels“tired"; but also that she now has reason to“stay
awake for a little longer.”*
[9]
3.1.2 Development
Symbolism
The title of Juniper's Knot  was chosen for its symbolic nature; for example,“Juniper”is an allusion to both the saint
known for his patience, and the given name that symbolises
chastity. “Knot”represents the fiend's magical barrier, a
circle which imprisons her from the rest of the world. The
resulting title“Juniper's Knot”foreshadowsthestory without being direct. The writer of the story, Terrence Smith,
compares “Juniper's Knot”as a forced chastity that will
take a long time to end; although, he says that the meaning
is also open to interpretation.*
[3] *[10]
Soundtrack
*
[11]
3.1.3 Reception
Juniper's Knot  received generally positive reviews for its
story and visuals. Dominic Tarason from The Indie Game
Magazine gave Juniper's Knot  the title of“Freeware Game
Pick”, stating thatthe novel'ssoundtrack“is emotive without being overbearing”. Tarason also called "[t]he writing
... an interesting mish-mash of slightly archaic wordings,
but it makes the characters a little more colourful”.
*
[7]
IndieGames.com weblogger Cassandra Khaw did the same,
praising Juniper's Knot  for “being an oddly lovely experience”, with an original story and “an abundance of …
anime-inspired artwork”.
*
[4]*
[13]*
[14]*
[15]
Josh Lemay of Sphereshifters gave it a nine out of ten.*
[16]
Dominic Tarason of Indiegamemag has said that he liked
the game, and the short amount of time taken to complete
the story (one month overall) is not visible.*

26 CHAPTER 3. VISUAL NOVELS BY DISCHAN MEDIA
3.2 ''Dysfunctional Systems'' series
(2013-)
Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel created by Dischan
Media. The story follows Winter Harrison, a “mediator"-in-training, as she attempts to resolve chaotic situations in different worlds. The first of several planned
episodes, Learning to Manage Chaos , was released on April
4, 2013*
[1]*
[4]*
[5] In February 2014, Dischan launched
a   Kickstarter  campaign to raise funds for another two
episodes of the story.*
[2]*
[6] Although the campaign met
and exceeded its funding goals, the project was cancelled
on January 2, 2015. * [7]
3.2.1 Gameplay
Gameplay from Episode 1. Here, Cyrus (right) is speaking to Winter.
Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel series, where the
player reads text to progress the story. At certain points,
the novel will present the player with a choice of different
dialogue or actions for the series protagonist, Winter Harrison, which will affect events and their consequences. The
novel includes a“codex”feature, where the reader can find
background information on thecurrentworld, such asits geography and politics, as well as topics related to the problems the world is experiencing. The novel also implements
a“profile”feature. The choices made during a play-through
of an episode can be saved in a profile, such that their consequences can be carried over to the next episode.*
[8]
3.2.2 Story
Setting and characters
In Dysfunctional Systems , Earth bears a utopian societywith
a school called“School Mediātōrum”, composed of individuals called “mediators”. Mediators are humans who
resolve chaotic situations in other worlds. Though these
worlds exist in different planes, and range in themes from
“dystopian, to futuristic or fantastical”, it is believed that
the chaos of any one world can adversely affect Earth as
well.*
[1]
Theprotagonist oftheseries, Winter Harrison,is a 14-yearold mediator-in-training. A moral individual, she still finds
the concept of “other worlds”hard to grasp.*
[9] On her
second mission (the focus of Episode 1) she is paired with
Cyrus Addington, a tough and infamous senior mediator, to
act as her guide and mentor.*
[10]
Episode 1: Learning to Manage Chaos
In the first episode, Winter and Cyrus travel to Sule, a
sporadically-progressing industrial planet. They arrive in
Brighton, a poor and minor country on Sule.*
[16] There,
the two find that the President of Brighton is attempting
to negotiate his society's freedom from its oppressor, the
wealthy state of Gabrea. The key object of his threat is an
untested nuclear bomb, waiting to be launched at Gabrea
via intercontinental ballistic missile.
*
[17]
Cyrus devises a plan to contain the chaos: to assassinate the
President and have him declared a martyr. Cyrus' plan horrifies Winter; at this point, the player can choose whether
Winter will go along with Cyrus' plan, or to rebel against
him and try to reason with the President instead.*
[18] If
Cyrus' plan is taken, the President is killed and his government decides to launch the weapon at Gabrea. If Winter's
plan is taken, she and Cyrus manage to convince the President to change his mind and fire his weapon into a nearby
sea as a warning shot instead.
However, in both cases, the detonation of the weapon goes
badly wrong, igniting the atmosphere and completely destroying Sule. Winter and Cyrus are teleported back to the
school on Earth just in time, where they are immediately
treated for radiation poisoning that they had obtained before Sule's destruction. Winter is carried back to her room,
where she recounts to her room-mate Waverly of Sule's
demise. The next day, Waverly fends off well-wishers from
seeing Winter, then helps her to her debriefing, ending the
episode.*
[16]
3.2.3 Development
In Dischan's earlier work, Juniper's Knot , the player can unlock bonus art featuring the protagonists of the story with
two other characters, Winter and Cyrus.
On January 5, 2013, Dischan leader Jeremy Miller announced the company's first series of visual novels, titled Dysfunctional Systems .
*
[13]*
[19] On June 5, 2013,
Dischan posted Episode 1 of Dysfunctional Systems  on
3.2. ''DYSFUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS'' SERIES (2013-) 27
Steam Greenlight.
*
[8]*
[20]*
[21] On September 26, 2013,
Episode 1 was released on Steam.*
[14]*
[15]
Kickstarter campaign
Despite reporting“decentsales”ofEpisode 1, Dischan admitted that the project was not a financial success. Dischan
turned to the crowd-funding site Kickstarter to raise funds
for the production of the second and third installments of
the novel. The campaign was opened for funding in February 2014, with the goal of raising C$49,000. By the end
of the campaign in March 2014, the campaign had successfully raised C$67,450. Because the original goal was
exceeded, Dischan stated that it would add more characters and environments to the second and third episodes than
they had originally intended, as well as producing a bonus
visual novel depicting Winter's first week as a mediator-intraining.*
[22]*
[23]
The project was cancelled in a January 2, 2015 announcement by Dischan and began issuing partial refunds through
Kickstarter to backers. * [24]
Soundtrack
The soundtrack to Episode 1, written and performed by
Kristian“CombatPlayer”Jensen, was released on 4thApril

in the jukebox within the game.

[29]*
[30]*
[31]   Gamezebo
criticised the novel for not striking a good balance between
story and interaction, giving the user few options throughout gameplay. However, it stated that the novel did “give
the audience a solid tale over lots of decision-making”,
which it considered favourably.*
[32] Nekoshiritori praised
the presentation of the novel, noting that the interface was
“very slick”and presented in 720p.
*
[33] Game Podunk
noted the novel's departure from traditional visual novels,
stating that “it decides to try something other than the
typical romance and slice of life visual novels that we’re
accustomed to”. It praised the science fantasy direction
of the novel.*

4.2 ''Long Live The Queen'' (2012)
Long Live The Queen is a visual novel role-playing video
game developed by Hanako Games and Spiky Caterpillar,
published by Hanako Games. The story of the game follows a young princess who is training to become queen after the death of her mother. The objective of the game is to
keep the princess alive for 40 weeks until she turns 15 and
is crowned.*
[1] The game was released on June 2, 2012 for
Windows, Mac OS and Linux. The game uses anime-style
graphics and is written in English.
*
[2]
4.2.1 Plot
The queen of Nova has recently died, and her daughter,
the 14-year-old princess Elodie, must leave her schooling
to ready herself to become the next queen. Her coronation
issetfor40weeksfrom thepresenther15thbirthday. Many
people in the kingdom are trying to take advantage of the
recent monarch's death and attempt to kill Elodie.*
[1]
4.2.2 Gameplay
The player reads through the story and schedules the protagonist's weeklylessons,in topicssuch as economy,foreign
affairs, logistics, expression, military matters, self-defense,
Political intrigue plays a key role in the game.
intrigues, doublespeak and magic. Based on those activities, Elodie increases her proficiency in various statistics.
Additionally, during the weekend Elodie has free run of
the castle and can choose an activity that alters her mood.
She has four emotional axes, and her position on each determines her proficiency at learning certain topics: for instance, being “Willful”will help her master military and
intrigue skills easier, but it will also hamper learning civil
skills like royal demeanor. Once allthree sub skills of a particular skill are raised to a certain point (around 30 each),
Elodie gains an outfit that boosts that specific skill. Learning some skills unlocks additional weekend actions: for example, learning “Dance”allows her to attend balls, while
“Reflexes”gives her the ability to play tennis.
As the weeks progress, Elodie is presented with various social and political opportunities. When they occur, the game
performs checks against Elodie's current skills and chooses
an outcome, sometimes without giving the playerthe option
of interceding. For instance, one of the first skill checks (a
snake attack) requires 10 points in the“Composure”skill.
Should Elodie be successful, she keeps her cool, allowing a
guard to kill the snake; should she fail, her cousin gets bitten, an event whose consequences can be felt in one specific
route the game can take. Most of the checks can be failed
without serious consequence, but some can close off entire
branches of the story. Very often however, passing or failing a skill check is a matter oflife or death forElodie: if her
skills aren't up to par, she dies (in one of various possible
ways).
Because of the branching decision trees, the game features
multiple endings, varying according to whom Elodie marries, how she dealtwith neighboring nations, her abilitywith
magic, the fate of her father Joslyn, and of course whether
she survived to her coronation at all.*

“There
’s a
depth to the characters and story that make it feel more real
than other visual novels I

convincing character exchanges, not to mention its impressive audio-visuals. So much so, that once I've gotten over
the disappointing results of my first-try ending, I'll no doubt
play through the whole thing again.

more evident in the sequel, though his attitude
is roughly the same, minus the immaturity. It is

5.3. ''THE FLOWER SHOP'' SERIES (2010-2011) 37
•   Natalie
The protagonist of The Flower Shop – Winter In
Fairbrook . She, like Steve from the first game, is
a“city girl”who hates waking up early, is used
to ordering pizza and take-outs for food, and is
unused to rural life. However, she improves consid actions, and may even win over a love interest
depending on the player's choices.
•   Jill
Steve's ex-girlfriend. She is one of the girls Steve
can date in The Flower Shop - Summer In Fairbrook . She wants to become a lawyer and strives
hard for that goal. She feels that Steve needs to
have some sense knocked into him, which is why
she thinks Stevebeing sent to Fairbrook is a good
idea. Jill is the only girl who does not appear in
the sequel Winter in Fairbrook . Instead, it is implied that she pursued her studies abroad, therefore rendering her route as not canon to the sequel because Steve can be dated in Winter . It is
also implied in certain endings of Winter in Fairbrook  that she and Ryan meet abroad and gain an
interest with one another.
•   Clara
An athletic girl who loves the big city. She is one
of the girls Steve can date in The Flower Shop -
Summer In Fairbrook . She also appears briefly
in the beginning of Winter in Fairbrook  as Natalie's roommate. Clara is the one who suggests
to Natalie that the latter work at Fairbrook over
the winter break. In some endings, Clara is implied to be the one chosen by Steve (if Steve's
path is not pursued) in Winter .
•   Marian
The librarian. She is one of the girls Steve can
date in The Flower Shop - Summer In Fairbrook .
She aspires to become a great poet but her dwindling self-confidence more than often gets in the
way. Her route in the first game focuses on Steve
andMarian working togetherto help the librarian
overcome her weakness. In Winter in Fairbrook ,
Marian is still a librarian at Fairbrook but is now
also a recognized poet and distinguished judge at
poem contests. Due to her busy schedule in the
sequel, Trent (Susana's brother) is now her assistant at the library. If Trent is not chosen as a love
interest in Winter , he and Marian will begin dating at the ending.
•   Susana
She runs the titular Flower Shop. She is one of
the girls Steve can date in The Flower Shop – 
Summer In Fairbrook . Susana is a kind and helpful soul, as evidenced by how kindly she treats
not only the protagonists but also the entire village. She is the one who offers Natalie her job in
Winter in Fairbrook . Though Susana is normally
sweet and caring, she is easily riled by the mere
mention of someone eating foods with preservatives or artificial additives due to (possibly) being
a vegetarian. If Jacob is not chosen as a love interest in Winter , Susana willstart noticing Jacob's
affections for her at the ending.
•   Trent
He is the older brother of Susana. He originally
appears briefly in Summer  as Susana's protective
brother and as a helper in later parts of the first
game. He is one of the boys Natalie can date in
The Flower Shop - Winter In Fairbrook . He is
loudmouthed and a little energetic, but he means
very well. Trent has a not-so-secret crush on
Marian, thelibrarian, who isthemain reasonwhy
he helps out at the library. He, however, finds a
kindred spirit in his enthusiasm with Natalie. If
he is not chosen as a love interest inWinter , Trent
and Marian will begin dating.
•   Ryan
He runs the general store. He is one of the boys
Natalie can date in The Flower Shop - Winter In
Fairbrook . Exclusively in Winter , Ryan is a calculative person. He appears brooding and cold
at first, but it becomes quickly apparent that his
facade is a just a result of poor communication
skills. His route begins when Natalie, who wants
someone to tutor her in school, asks for Ryan's
assistance (who is a professional tutor) in Math.
In exchange for help at schoolwork, Natalie will
help Ryan overcome his shyness and lack of social skills. If Ryan is not chosen as a love interest Winter , he will go abroad to study. Certain endings imply that he meets a girl studying
law abroad (heavily implied to be Jill, Steve's exgirlfriend) and they find an interest in each other.
•   Jacob
38 CHAPTER 5. VISUAL NOVELS BY RIVA CELSO 
He is helping out Clara's father. He is one of the
boysNatalie candate inTheFlowerShop - Winter 
In Fairbrook . In Summer in Fairbrook , Jacob is a
young man helping out at Clara's family farm. In
the first game, he has a one-sided crush on Clara,
the farmer's daughter, which Steve immediately
picks up on. He appears as the most childish of
the cast, something which bothers him deeply.
In Winter , his crush is transferred to Susana, the
flower shop owner. Here, Jacob is more bothered about the fact that despite he tries his best at
work, people around him still seem to treat him
like a child. His route focuses on Natalie proving
to Jacob that he doesn't have anything to worry
about. If Jacob is not chosen as a love interest
in Winter , Susana will begin to realize and return
Jacob's affections for her.
Minor characters
•   Michael
The father of Steve. Younger brother of Sam.
Apparently, a really strict and overbearing father,
Michael is the one who sends Steve all the way
out to Fairbrook in order to teach the young man
a lesson. Despite his harsh treatment of his son,
however, Michael still cares for Steve in his own
unique ways.
•   Uncle Sam
He is Steve's uncle and the brother of Steve's father. He has a cat called Orpheus. Uncle Sam is
the total opposite of Michael: While Michael is
cold and overbearing, Sam is more energetic and
teasing. His body is not as strong as it used to
be, which is why he gratefully accepts Steve's arrival in Fairbrook and teaches the boy the tricks
ofthetrade. In thesequel, he appearsless andhas
less impact on the plot, mostly appearing during
Steve's route.
5.3.4 Development
The games were created with Ren'Py. The writing was
done by Ayu Sakata while the art was provided by M. Beatriz García. Winter Wolves also released free demos of

5.3.5 Reception
The first game received a score of 85/100 on Gamertell,
with reviewer Jenni Lada writing“It moves at a good pace,
has the farming aspect to add variety and keep it from only
being about reading and picking choices and is pleasant to
look at and listen to.”*

[2]
Mac Games  gave 3,5 of 5 stars to the first game and wrote:
“It appears this game is aimed towards young girls, but I
think you should try it even if you do not fall in that category. The music is muted and appropriate, and the anime
characters well done.”*

5.5. ''LOREN THE AMAZON PRINCESS'' (2012) 39
5.4.1 Gameplay
The game offers a mix of classic visual novel gameplay,
with dialogues andmany choices to make, with role-playing
video game-style battles. The player has the ability to
choose the gender of the protagonist. For every gender
there are three optional romance endings, for a total of 6
different romance endings.
5.4.2 Reception
The game received a score of 78/100 on Gamertell, with
reviewer Jenni Lada writing “Planet Stronghold isn't for
everyone. It's a good game, but it's also quite challenging.
This may dissuade beginners or typical visual novel players,
who may not be accustomed to level-grinding characters,
seeking out extra battles and carefully managing character
equipment to keep everyone at their best.”*
[1]
Mac Games  gave 4 of 5 stars and wrote: “The anime artwork is exquisite as always with great alien drawings. The
instructions are clear and stats detailed.”*
[2]
GameZebo gave 3,5 of 5 stars and wrote: “If Planet
Stronghold has a weakness, it’s that the story and characters in and of themselves aren’t especially interesting.
The game isn’t poorly written or even poorly translated,
it’s just a bit generic given the type of anime sci-fi fare
that’s clearly influenced it. That doesn’t matter quite so
much when the game is simply fun to play for its own sake,
which it is.”*
[3]
Ratings Per Game explained and criticized the flaws in parts
of the games combat mechanics. Such as the music not
looping, the Grenades not being able to stack, and obvious
chosen one aspect with the Nelson family. However she
stated it was worth playing if you could overlook the flaws
in the story and mechanics. The artwork, while praised, did
get criticized on the costume design.*

A sequel is in production stages and expected for a release
in 2015.

5.5 ''Loren the Amazon Princess''
(2012)
Loren The Amazon Princess is a Fantasy RPG visual novel
by Winter Wolves. The game was released on April 30,
2012. The game works for the Linux,   Mac OS, and
Microsoft Windows platforms. The expansion The Castle
Of N'mar  was released on September 28, 2012.
5.5.1 Gameplay
The game offers a mix of classic visual novel gameplay,
with RPG elements. The player reads through the story
and occasionally has to fight against fantasy monsters. At
the beginning the player can choose between a male human
protagonist and a female elven protagonist. Furthermore,
it offers a variety of romance options with the party members, including homosexual relationships, and has different
endings, based on the choices of the player and the relationships.
Battles can take place between theplayer's party anda party
of enemies, with a maximum of six characters on each side.
Each party consists of a front row, that is typically occupied
by warrior type characters and can be attacked by anyone,
and a back row, which typically holds weaker ranged and
magical characters, that melee characters can only attack if
the front row is unoccupied, in which case all on the back
row will be forced to the front. Characters are able to swap
places with others, or can move into unoccupied spaces on
their turn, and warriors can gain the ability to force a character to swap with the one behind them.
Characters take it in turns to attack, with their speed, as
well as the moves they use, determining how long they must
wait. When a character's turn comes up, they have the
choice of either attacking an enemy with their equipped
weapon or abilities, using an ability to support the party, usingan itemfor either healing or offense, orswitchingplaces.
Should everyone in the player's party be killed, the player
can reload a previous save. The player does not have the
option of fleeing a battle, but should they win, the health
and MP of all characters will be completely refilled, except
40 CHAPTER 5. VISUAL NOVELS BY RIVA CELSO 
at certain points of the story. As the player gains more followers, exceeding the maximum number of people they can
have in a battle, they can reorganise the battle group outside
of battles.
Characters are divided into three classes, the first two of
which can be selected for the player character: Warriors,
who possess powerful melee moves and can wear heavy armor, but are largely limited to attacking enemies in the front
row, Thieves, who can wield bows to shoot at any enemy,
and have skillsets focused on taking advantage of enemies
being put into weakened states, and Mages, who have accessto magic attacksthat canhit multiple enemies wherever
they are, but have less endurance than the other classes. In
addition, each character has a specialization giving them a
further variety of abilities, e.g. both Loren and Amukiki
are warriors, however Loren's specialization gives her abilities based around dual-wielding weapons, while Amukiki's
gives him ones that focus on supporting the player's party.
Whatever class the player character has, their specialization
will always focus on healing abilities.
5.5.2 Plot
The game begins with Loren, the princess of the Amazons,
who has to find her mother, Karen, the queen of the Amazons, who has gone missing. She starts her journey with
the protagonist, a slave of the Amazons with healing magic.
Since Amazon law forbids a princess from leaving their
home, theCitadel, Loren isforced to renounceher princesshood, and with it her access to the Amazons assets.
On their journeytheyare joined bya varietyof companions,
including the dwarves Ramas and Dora, the half-elf Draco,
the Elder Druid Myrth and the elf assassin Rei. Ultimately
they find Karen, discovering that she had attempted to run
away with her slave, who she had fallen in love with, and
was killed by lizardmen. While on the journey, Loren takes
possession of the Hawk Blade, a sword that Myrth explains
is a weapon granted by the Gods, and that for Loren to have
it means that she will have a huge impact on the world.
Grob, a servant of the Death Knight Fost, tricks the Human
Empire and the Elves of GrandTree into going to war with
one another, supposedly to keep them distracted from his
plans. Archwizard Apolimesho andMyrth, representingthe
humans and elves respectively, discover the treachery and
ask Loren and her comrades to end the war. They proceed
to find proof that Fost has returned and that the demons of
Everburn are a more important threat than either side in the
war, and an alliance is agreed on between the two races and
the Amazons.
After disagreements between the elves and humansthreaten
to fracture the alliance, it is decided that Loren should be
in command of the combined forces. To convince the elven and human leaders of this, the party kill Krul, a nomad who has been harassing the human city of Horus with
his orc army, as well as the succubus Jul, a servant of Fost
who has bewitched the dark elves. Upon returning to the
Citadel, they discover the Amazons have been afflicted with
a magical plague, forcing them to work with the dark witch
Chambara to develop a cure. Once this is concluded, the
party learn that both sides have been forced to give control
of their armies to Loren.
The alliance invades Everburn, forcing their way to Fost's
castle. During the invasion, Loren, Karen and the protagonist learn from Apolimesho that in order to destroy Fost for
good, one of them must sacrifice themselves to do so. As
the party storms the castle, a ceiling collapses, sending the
party into the Under-Realm, a plane of existence between
the mortal world and the afterlife. The protagonist makes
their way through the Under-Realm, before encountering
Fost, and facing him along with Loren, Karen and whatever
members of their party they had managed to recover. After defeating Fost, the protagonist must choose whether to
stop Loren or Karen from sacrificing themselves, or to do
so themself.
Whatever choice is made, an epilogue shows the fates of
all the party members and those who helped them. If the
protagonist did not sacrifice themself, they are revealed to
be the writer ofthe story mentioned atthe start ofthe game,
whereas if they did, the writer is Loren.

5.5.7 Reception
The game received a score of 83/100 on TechnologyTell,
with reviewer Jenni Lada writing: “While I’ll admit I
bristled a bit at the fan-service in Loren: Amazon Princess ,
even with the censor option turned on, it’s worth overlooking as the battle system is well arranged and challenging and the overall story of a young man or woman rising
fromslavery to become secondin commandof an army that
will help save the world is very well done. I especially liked
how the decisions, mostly those made in the fourth chapter,
did influence the ending and epilogue. While it may be a
bit expensive and is definitely only for mature audiences,
it’s well made, tells an interesting tale and I could honestly see playing through it a second time to see what effect
different choices would have on the story.”*
[3] Capsule
Computers review gave 8.5 of 10 points to the game and
wrote: "Loren: The Amazon Princess  is a solidly built game
and it has a lot of different options and choices for players
to work through. The game totes how a player can’t do it
all in one playthrough and even the romance aside, it can’
t be. Featuring a heck of a lot of replay value, this game
provides plenty of hours of enjoyment and what is actually
about two novels of game text.”*

party that offered her more money. When the protagonist,
Gurski, and Kizaki confront Bergstrom, she tries to run; the
others manage to trap her, however, and she confesses. Detective Gurski snaps a pair of handcuffs on her wrists and
leads her outside. Kizaki, who says his real name is Naoki,
wants the protagonist to help him finding out who the third
party Sara mentioned is. Later, Naoki's twin sister, Aki,
shows up personally and offers the protagonist to work with
them. However, she makes clear that he needs their help
more than they need his.
In the epilogue, it is revealed that Chance played a double
role as well. She calls someone, telling them that she could
not get the USB drive they wanted. Then she claims that
she found someone the person has been looking for the
main protagonist.
Kansei 
After the events of Jisei , the protagonist finds himself tangled in another murder case when the owner of a high profile corporation dies under mysterious circumstances. This
time, however, he's forced to team up with a group of kids
with abilities as strange as his own. Early in the game, Aki
gives the protagonist a nickname, “Kangai”, as he wants
to keep his true name hidden.
Aki drives Kangai, Naoki, and Li Mei to the house of
William Auten, the chairperson of Auten Engineering.
There, they met Mr. Auten's assistant Sophia Millerson, as
well as Detective Mikolaj Gurski, who was invited because
he solved the murder case the day before. Furthermore,
Kangai meets the reporter Marissa Klein, Mr. Auten's
nephew Liam, and the IT guy Kevin Nealy. When Kangai
and the others are asked to go into William Auten's office
and Mr. Auten sees Kangai through a camera, he seems to
recognize him and wants to throw him out of the house. He
is frightened of him and he does not want to meet him any
more. When suddenly William Auten is found dead in his
office, Kangai has to solve the case. While he is looking
for clues, he learns from Li Mei, that she, Aki, and Naoki
work forthe government, that they are on probation for past
crimes, and that Detective Gurski is their probation officer.
Kangai finds an SD card in a box in Mr. Auten's museum. Shortly after, it turns out that Kevin has poisoned
Mr. Auten. Kevin takes Li Mei hostage and threatens her
with a knife. Suddenly Detective Gurski comes into the
room, he calls Kangai Alex. Together they are able to catch
Kevin and to arrest him. The next day Detective Gurski
comes over to tell Alex and the others that Kevin has confessed and that Liam has disappeared.
In the epilogue is Liam who has obtained some things for
Chance. Judging from their conversation it could be that
Liam and Chance are siblings or half-siblings. After Liam
has given her the things which she wanted to have for years,
she lets him leave. She tells him that he should enjoy the
rest of his pitiful life. According to her there is not much
left of it after all.

his placement in a school for the disabled, he eventuA scene from the early part of the game showing (left to right) Lilly,

ally adapts to his new lifestyle. Through his new relationships and interactions, he begins to reconsider his
preconceptionstowards disabilities, including his own.
His main hobbies include reading and chess.
Emi Ibarazaki (茨崎笑美 Ibarazaki Emi ) Emi is an energetic, extroverted  blonde  girl with   twintails and
forest-green eyes. She has prosthetic legs, having had
her original legs amputated below the knees as a result
of a car accident. Despite her disability, she still has
more than enough lower body strength to walk, and
in fact she is a successful track runner. She values
good diet and exercise, and is on friendly terms with
the head nurse of Yamaku; she promises to keep tabs
on Hisao's exercise in exchange for having him as a
running partner. Indeed, she meets Hisao by literally
running into him in the hallway, and ironically endangers his heart on more than one occasion. Hisao feels
guilty whenever she pouts, equating her expression to
that of a sad puppy. Emi is Rin's friend and hall mate
due to both having extremely passionate vocations and
complementary disabilities. However, she has trouble getting emotionally close to people, because she is
afraid of losing people important to her. Her question
is “Can you stand up for yourself?".
Hanako Ikezawa (池沢華子 Ikezawa Hanako)  Hanako,
as a child, suffered an accident in which her house
was burned down, taking the lives of her parents.
The right side of her body is heavily scarred from
the incident and has left her traumatized. Her long,
dark purple hair hangs down her back, and her bangs
cover the right side of her face, which hides much
of her scars. Due to the flames, she has spent most
of her childhood in an orphanage and was bullied
during her time in elementary and middle school,
50 CHAPTER 7. OTHER VISUAL NOVELS 
so she was offered to go to Yamaku because of the
discourse. Initially, she is incredibly shy towards
anyone except Lilly and Akira. She is another one of
Hisao's classmates, but is frequently absent, preferring
to spend time reading in the library where she can be
alone. Her question is “Can you face your fears?"
Lilly Satou (砂藤リリー Satō Rirī ) Lilly isthe class representative of 3-2, a class composed of blind and partially blind students (including Kenji); she has been
blind since birth. The tallest member of the main female cast, she has long blonde hair and blue eyes
her father is Japanese and her mother is Scottish with
family in Inverness. She is very polite and ladylike
with a motherly demeanour, not wanting to intrude on
others' private life (including Hisao's reasons for being at Yamaku). It is also noted that she had previously attended a strict all-girls school. In contrast to
Misha's fast-paced attitude to Hisao's transfer, Lilly
takes things at her own relaxed pace, helping Hisao
to adjust to school life in the midst of a busy festival.
She is Hanako's closest and initially only friend; she
regularly has lunch and tea with her, and accompanies
her grocery shopping. She is also on a friendly basis
with Yuuko. Shizune and Lilly have been seen to not
get along, perhaps due to the fact that direct communication between her and Shizune is not feasible (she
cannot see Shizune's sign language and Shizune cannot hear her or speak to her). Her question is “Can
you see what I see?".
Different dialogue choicesleadto newbranchingpaths andendings.
Charactersshown (fromleft to right): Misha, Shizune, andHanako.
Rin Tezuka (手塚琳 Tezuka Rin) Rin, a girl whose arms
were almost entirely amputated due to a birth defect,
uses her feet to accomplish everyday tasks with surprising dexterity. Shehasshortredhair anddark green
eyes, and wears a boy's uniform to avoid the awkward
situations that would arise from using her feet while
wearing a skirt. Rin's unique personality has brought
about awkward situationswith herpeers, especiallyfor
Hisao, and as a result, somepeopledo not talkwith her
such as Lilly. She is nonchalant with theotherstudents
and about their disabilities in general; she usually inquiries about other people's disabilities as a hobby. As
a result, she is seen as extremely blunt, especially with
the mention of her period. She is Emi's friend and
hall mate, as their physical abilities complement each
other. Her role in the school festival is being the sole
painter of a giant mural posted in front of the dorms.
Her name was designed as both a homage to legendary
cartoonist Osamu Tezuka as well as a pun based of her
talent as an artist and disability (the first kanji in her
surname means“hand”).*
[7] Her question is“Can
you seize the day?".
Shizune Hakamichi (羽加道静音 Hakamichi Shizune)
Shizune is one of Hisao's classmates who serves as
the student council president and class representative
of class 3-3. This bespectacled girl has short dark
blue hair and eyes; she is both  deaf and   mute,
communicating primarily through sign language.
Her friend, Misha, is almost always at her side,
translating everything from and to Shizune, allowing
for communication with other people. As others
have described her including herself, Shizune is
strong-willed, forceful, and manipulative; she seldom
displays a softer side and sometimes shows a face that
reveals her emotions. She has an intense intolerance
of Lilly and initially indirectly dislikes Hanako as
a result. Her name was designed by the game's
developers to be a pun based on her disability; the
kanji for her given name mean“silent”and“sound”
.
*
[7] Her question is “Can you tell me what you
think?".
Shiina Mikado (御門椎名 Mikado Shiina) Also known
as Misha (ミーシャ Mīsha), she is Shizune's best
friend and only fellow member in the student council. She serves as her interpreter, and is the first to befriend Hisao in Yamaku. She has long curls of (dyed)
pink hair and gold eyes. She is friendly and cheerful, though her enthusiastic tone for most things have
sometimes tired those around her. Despite being a relatively major character in Act 1, she is not a potential
romantic interest to Hisao, but instead, she helps him
get used to the school in his first few days of his transfer; she does however become a potential love interest in the Shizune arc as Hisao can engage in an affair with Misha, leading on to the bad ending. As well
as helping Shizune convince Hisao to join the student
7.4. ''KATAWA SHOUJO'' (2012/2013) 51
council. Misha attends Yamaku as part of a sign language recruitment program, making her one ofthefew
“normal”(i.e. having no disability) students attending
the school. She did not appear in the original concept
sketch by RAITA.
Minor
Kenji Setou (瀬藤健二 Setō Kenji ) Kenji is Hisao's
roommate (next-door neighbor in the dorms), who
is legally blind, being unable to see anything unless
he is almost an inch close to them. He appears to
be a hikikomori and very anti-social, claiming to be
the “last sane man in an insane world.”He often
rants about feminist conspiracy theories, claiming
that feminists are evil and want to rule the world
(these feelings are revealed to stem from his feeling
tired after having intercourse with his ex-girlfriend a
year before the story starts), among other pointless
subjects, possibly rivaling Rin's “uniqueness”in that
aspect. Kenji's route is the bad ending of Act 1 if the
player does not choose one girl to befriend over the
course of Act 1.
Nurse (ナース Nāsu) The head nurse of Yamaku whose
name is not given. He is friendly to all of his students
andpatients, butcan quickly become stern ifhis advice
is not taken seriously. He asks Emi to be his “spy”
for keeping tabs on Hisao, making sure he gets proper
exercise. He first appears after Hisao leaves Shizune
and Misha and go to the doctors' block for the first
time. His lack of name and his relationship with Emi
were influenced by a series of threads on 4chan that
chronicled a real, nameless male nurse in charge of
young multiamputee car crash victim.*
[7]
Akio Mutou (武藤昭夫 Mutō Akio) Mutou is Hisao's
homeroom teacher, and the science teacher of class
3-3. He is just as much out of touch with his class as
he is out of touch with reality. Probably born to be a
teacher (no matter how much his students disagree),
his greatest skill is the ability to ignore irrelevant
things completely (no matter how much anyone who
wishes he'd remember their names disagrees). He
first appears as Hisao enters the halls in the beginning
of the game. His design was largely based upon David
Tennant as the Tenth Doctor of Doctor Who.
*
[17]
Yuuko Shirakawa (白川優子 Shirakawa Yūko) Yuuko
is the librarian who is on friendly terms with Lilly and
Hanako. She has serious problems with managing her
life, which makes her the perfect person to ask for
help to manage one's own. She funds her university
studies by working part-time at a popular cafe. The
lengths she goes to avoid being fired for her natural
clumsiness bewilder other people, along with her
neurotic attention to detail and frequent streaks of
depression. She first appears when Lilly takes Hisao
to the library, and Lilly calls out her name. It is
revealed that she used to have a younger boyfriend
who disappeared on her. In the files of the leaked
beta version of the visual novel, this “mysterious
boyfriend”was revealed to be Kenji Setou. These
scripts did not make it into the final game.
Akira Satou (砂藤晃 Satō Akira) Akira is Lilly's older
sister. She's a lawyer for the Japanese branch of her
father's company. She dresses in a man's pinstripe suit
and has the tomboy-like attitude to match, often as a
slightly irresponsible, friendly foil to her sister's personality. She appears through several routes, primarily Lilly's and Hanako's. She is often seen with her
cousin, Hideaki Hakamichi.
Hideaki Hakamichi (羽加道秀明 Hakamichi Hideaki )
Hideaki is Shizune's younger brother. He's very intelligent and shares an attitude similar to that of his
sister. He dresses in very feminine clothing, a fact
that he rarely acknowledges.
Jigoro Hakamichi (羽加道治五郎 Hakamichi Jigorō )
Jigoro is Shizune's father. He is stubborn, mean, and
a braggart. He is confrontational with most everyone
and shows off constantly, from talking about his
in-progress autobiography to carrying a katana with
him at all times.
Iwanako (岩魚子)
*
[7]  Iwanako is Hisao's former girlfriend, from prior to his initial heart attack, which occurs during her confession of love during the prologue
of the story. They eventually drift apart completely
during his hospital stay. In every route of the game,
Hisao receives a letter from her; his response (whether
he writes back, reads it completely, etc.) differs by
route.
Miki Miura (三浦美貴 Miura Miki )  Miki is a student
and classmate of Hisao's in Class 3-3. She is an amputee, missing her left hand below her wrist, which
is covered in bandages. She's is on the track team
and is considered the second fastest in the school, behind only Emi. Despite this, she is not mentioned,
nor does she appear in Emi's route (outside of background shots). Rather, she is mentioned once in Lilly's
route, and interacts with Hisao for only a small portion of Hanako's route. A route for Miki was planned
52 CHAPTER 7. OTHER VISUAL NOVELS 
but scrapped during development; an early draft of
the route script (written from Miki's perspective) was
posted online in December 2014 by the contributing
author.*
[18]
Shinichi Nomiya (野宮紳一 Nomiya Shin'ichi ) Nomiya
is Yamaku's art teacher, and as such only appears
for Rin's arc. A fat, eccentric man, he was once a
promising painter but gave it up to teach. He has an
almost obsessive drive towards making Rin a famous
painter.
Sae Saionji (西園寺さえ Saionji Sae) Sae is the owner
of an art gallery in the city and is an old friend of
Nomiya's. She is a smoker and a former artist herself. She appears prominently only towards the end of
Rin's route.
Meiko Ibarazaki (茨崎芽依子 Ibarazaki Meiko)  Meiko
is Emi's mother. She appears briefly in Rin's route,
and features more prominently in Emi's. She appears
rather young and attractive, and has been described
by Hisao as an older version of Emi, after observing
that she acts very much like her daughter.
7.4.3 Critical reception
Katawa Shoujo received generally favorable critical reception. Upon release, it was praised by some reviewers and
fans, who most notably praised the game's sincere and respectful treatment ofthe setting.*
[11]*
[19] The game'ssensitive handling of its eroge elements, instances of soft core
erotic imagery on the relevant forks which were integral to
its narratives, was also praised (it was also noted that as
“adult content”is removed the game can be played with
these scenes replaced, withoutthe cost oflosingmuch characterization and plot development).*
[20] Other critics were
less warm, withDave Rileyof OtakuUSA Magazine claiming the game had “bad prose and bad characters.”
Controversy
The game's name itself, however, has attracted some criticism, as the term“katawa”(⽚輪) is considered an archaic
derogatory term in Japan.“Katawa Shoujo”translates into
“Disability Girl”in English, but a more literal translation of
“katawa”from Japanese is “cripple”, and more literally
refers to a vehicle with just one wheel and thus working imperfectly.*
[21] In response to questions regarding the usage
ofthe term“katawa”, the developers commented,“It's not
like we intentionally want to offend, and we did not come
up with the name ourselves. The origin of the name is of
course Japanese itself, with Raita and his original concept
picture of [Katawa Shoujo].”*
[22]
7.4.4 Soundtrack
The game's soundtrack, entitled Enigmatic Box of Sound ,
was released for download on January 20, 2012.*
[23] It
was written primarily by musicians Sebastien “NicolArmarfi”Skaf and Andy“Blue123”Andi. An updated version of “Red Velvet”was released alongside the French
language update on July 8, 2013, featuring  saxophone
player Japes.*
[24] Two previously unreleased bonus tracks,
“When It's Hard to Smile”and“Carefree Days”, were released separately on February 10, 2010 and December 24,
2014, respectively.*
[25]*
[26]
7.4.5 April Fools pranks
Every year of production, even in the years prior to the
game's release, the Four Leaf Studios team have held a
tradition of making April Fools Day prank post on their
developer's blog. These jokes take the form of fake
announcements of upcoming features or updates, sometimes satirizing real-world habits of video game publishers and developers. Among these announcement pranks
have included sequels(andcancellationsthereof),*
[27] high
definition and censored  re-release,*
[28] expansion packs
DLC, microtransactions and bonus content, exclusive merchandise, advertisement removal, premium content, online
distribution through Steam,
*
[29] an anime adaptation by
Studio DEEN,
*
[30] voice acting,
*
[31] and a second, parody visual novel project.*

7.5 ''This Is Where I Want To Die''
(2013)
This Is Where I Want To Die (sometimes: TIWIWTD) is a
free utsuge visual novel developed and published by Marcel
Weyers, an author and translator. The game was released
on March 17, 2013 for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. An
updated version was released on May 9, 2013. The Android
version by Visualnovels.nl wasreleased on July 5, 2013.*
[1]
In June 2014, Weyers released the game To Kill A Black 
Swan with similar themes, which is part of the same series.
7.5.1 Gameplay & Design
Theplayersimplyreadsthroughthe story. Since thegameis
a so-calledkinetic novel, theplayer does notmakedecisions
and there is only one ending. The game uses silhouettes as
characters and blurry black and white backgrounds. The
protagonist, however, is notshown until the very end. Music
and sound effects support the game's atmosphere.
54 CHAPTER 7. OTHER VISUAL NOVELS 
7.5.2 Plot
You wake up in a hospital room and you realize that you
are about to die. You cannot remember what happened and
you try to think about why you are in the hospital. In order
to do this, you see flashbacks from your past. You were
going to a bar with your best friend Ann and your boyfriend
Brad. On the way to the Bar, you proposed to Brad and
he accepted. To celebrate this occasion, you went to the
most expensive bar in town. Brad explained that he wanted
to take you on a holiday to the sea. You and your friends
enjoyed the evening together. However, on the way back
home you bid goodbye to Ann and decided to walk alone
with Brad. You came upon two men who attacked you for
apparently no reason. At the end, one of the guys stabbed
you andyou bled to death. Back atthehospital,itisrevealed
that the protagonist is a homosexual man and the attackers
killed him for trying to protect his boyfriend. The message
of the game is stopping homophobia.
7.5.3 Characters
•   Brad is yourboyfriend. You've beentogetherforthree
years but lately he seems to have something on his
mind. What might it be...?
• Ann is your best friend. She has always been supportive of your love for Brad. But... could she be hiding
something?
7.5.4 Development and translations
The game was developed with Ren'Py, an engine for visual
novels. The story and characters were developed by Marcel Weyers. The music was created by Marcel Weyers as
well. The cover art was designed by SD Designs. Backgrounds, character art, and sound effects were take from
free sources and edited by Marcel Weyers. The game was
created in less than a month. A trailer was released on
March 10, 2013.
*
[2] It wasreleased inEnglish and German
and was later translated into French by Kevin Cottenie and
into Spanish by Nessy Noinex. A Dutch translation by Visualnovels.nl  was added on May 28, 2013. On September
27, 2013, the game was updated with an Italian translation
by Andrea Luciano 'Lehti' Damico. It is the third visual
novel game by Marcel Weyers after Soulmates  and Sleepless 
Night .

7.5.6 Reception
weeaboo.nl  wrote about the game:“Not knowing who you
are makes for a tiresome read (since you continuously need
to take every possibility into account). Everything up until
the final 30 seconds is just there for padding/misdirection.”
*
[5]
 freegamearchive gavea score of66% and said:“Somebody
writes his opinion into the newspapers, somebody writes a
book, somebody shouts it on streets and one can make an
interesting game. [...] The truth is uncovered rather soon
and so the experience isn’t so enrichment. Someone can
disagree with the uncovered thing and theme but it depends
on what you think.”*
[6]
The game was nominated for the 2013 Best Ofs by VNs 
Now! in the category“Best Drama”along with The Royal 
Trap by Hanako Games and other visual novels.*
